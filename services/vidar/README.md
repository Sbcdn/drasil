## Mythology
In Norse mythology, Vidar is one of the Aesir and Odin's son. He belongs to the circle of gods whose function and meaning are somewhat problematic to circle. Even the god's name has given rise to completely different interpretations. According to one interpretation, the name means "the wide ruler", according to another "he of the forest", "the warrior of the forest" or the like. Vidar is also called "the silent ace" or "the silent god".

Vidar certainly appears in Grimnesmål as the ruler of his kingdom of Vide , the "forest land", but apart from this reference, the image of a powerful, vengeful god predominates. In Skáldskaparmál it is said that Vidar is called "Avenger of the Gods". Vidar's primary mythological function is precisely that of an avenger: at Ragnarök he avenges his father Odin. In that respect, he is functionally close to the god Vale whose mythological function was precisely that of Balder 's avenger. Odin fathered both Vidar and Vale through extramarital relations. Vidar's mother is said to be the giantess Grid .
